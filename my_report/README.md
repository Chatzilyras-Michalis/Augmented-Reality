# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
- (Cylinder) For starters i created a new a-entity for the cylinder with the code i found in a A-frame from resources and changed the radius and height based on what i thought was better looking for me.
(Sphere) I proceeded with same mindset as the cylinder coding and changed the radius only for the sphere.
- (Snow) For the addition of the snow i copied the code i found in npmjs and added the command visible="false".
- (Speech command,annayang)From the npmjs i added the annyang-speech-recognition component code
- (Speech-command) For the appearance and disappearance of the snow i added inside the a-entity of snow the speech-command_show and speech-command_hide.The snow appears when we say start and disappears when we say stop.The two lines of speech-command were found on npmjs below the command of annyang.
